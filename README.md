# 🌐 Cyber Threat Visualization Dashboard

This project is a data visualization dashboard built to display global cybersecurity threats from 2015 to 2024. It allows users to dynamically view different charts—such as top threat types, affected industries, attack trends by year, and top impacted countries—based on a dropdown menu selection.
